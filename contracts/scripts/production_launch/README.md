# Starting The Contract

This folder should be used after the contracts have been compiled.

Add in the reference wallet address to the script_reference.addr file.

Create the script references. This assumes the starter wallet is in a lovelace only state.

Create the data UTxO. The starter wallet needs to have the starter token at this point.

Register the stake and delegate with the starter token.

The starter wallet will be creating all the UTxOs so it will need to be funded about 125 ADA.
