# Starting The Contract

This folder should be used after the contracts have been compiled.

Add in the reference wallet address to the script_reference.addr file.

Create the script references. This assumes the starter wallet is in a lovelace only state.

The starter wallet will be creating all the UTxOs so it will need to be funded.
