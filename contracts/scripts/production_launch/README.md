# Starting The Contract

This folder should be used after the contracts have been compiled.

Add in the reference wallet address to the script_reference.addr file.

Create the script references. Create the data UTxO. Register the stake and delegate.

The starter wallet will be creating all the UTxOs so it will need to be funded.
